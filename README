== Description ==

This package contains different implementations of diffusion maps for the
following languages
- Scilab
- Matlab
- Python

=== What is diffusion maps? ===

This is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique used in machine learning,
artificial intelligence, and computer vision. It is useful for both supervised
and non-supervised learning. It was proposed by Steve
Zucker, R. Coifman, S. Lafon, and others. It bears many similarities with
Google's Pagerank algorithm the idea of random walks on graphs.

== Disclaimer ==

Most of this code is experimental research code that started being developed
during 2012-2013.
